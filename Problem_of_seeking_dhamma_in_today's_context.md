#### <b><u> Problem of seeking dhamma in today's context </u></b> 

Most of the young, today are not fluent with paali or sinhala due to `meaning degredation`(artha parihaaniya). so people tend to seek dhamma from youtube. There are so many dhamma videos in youtube but navigating this is like an ocean. Not an easy thing to do. Specially if you dont know where to start, what are the next steps. how to identify `sathdhamma` from the ocean of dhamma videos. this is an impossible task. (without some help)

There are so many videos of thero's , upaasaka people who understood the real message of budda.  But for a person who is keen to find what `sathdhamma` is , its like getting in to ocean with out really knowing where you are going.

so when i started searching (3 years back) it was not easy to understand which areas of knowledge is missing and what should i learn next.

One thing was certain, without a help from kalyana mitta, this journey was impossible. this is not something i can ever find by my own. ocean was too large for me to cover.
also `you cant search, if you dont know what you are searching`.

This collection repersent every step i took from the begining. 
problems i faced, solutions discussed. moving from one `view point` to another. how to navigate this dhamma ocean. avoiding attachement to every `viewpoint` (ditti)

I wanted to leave this collection as a stepping stone for `true dhamma seekers` specially as a guidence towards how to nagivate todays dhamma repersentations.
