# In Search of dhamma.

in life, when you keep doing whats important to you, you will slowly realize that no matter how hard you try to control outside world ( world that is relative to you), it require lot of effort and energy for very less gain in return. No matter how hard we try to be successful in life, we tend to measure it with things like money, wealth, social acceptance. 
all of efforts to build money, wealth, acceptance is done purely assuming that being successful provide mental happiness , ability to be happy is there when you have enough money to spend and buy what we desire.

So this collection represent step by steps of my journey in searching dhamma. am leaving it documented on each and every step so it can be help full for someone who is keen to finding the truth of life.
