faith - Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence."
	- kalama suththrayata anuwa - not to even accept even it was said by budda, but to apply our own experience and reasonning to determine what is truth or not
	- based on Zen - 
		- We define "faith" as an absence of doubt, and "doubt" as an absence of faith.
		- "My miracle is that when I'm hungry, I eat, and when I am tired, I sleep." Even so, a Zen proverb says that a Zen student must have great faith, great doubt, and great determination.
		-  faith and doubt are like two end of the stick, you can hold to one side of the stick and you can poke the ground, no matter which side you use, you are in the journey, so you trust the stick to clear your way
		- me shardda ( faith)
			- faith and doubt in religious sense is openness
			- We might reject these teachings out of hand. They don't conform to the way we already understand the world, we think, so they must be wrong. However, Buddhism is built on a hypothesis that the way we experience ourselves and our lives are an illusion. Refusing to even consider an alternative way to look at reality means the journey is over before it's begun.

Another way to process difficult teachings is to try to "make sense" of them intellectually, and then we develop views and opinions about what the teachings mean. But the Buddha warned his disciples over and over again to not do that. Once we've attached to our limited view the quest for clarity is over.

So, the challenge is to neither believe nor disbelieve, or attach to some "meaning," but to trust the practice and remain open to insight. 

when a trust and beleif system is build around a faith, it can often take you in to opiniated route.
