#### <b><u> Why search dhamma </u></b> 



In life all of you want to be `happy`, have good experiences and avoid sadness at all times. so in order to chase that dream (desired state) you undertake hardship but the happiness doesnt stay, it comes and goes, never permenant. after sometime you undertake this hardship as a survival cycle. you just endure weight of the hardship, because of the value you have given to the dream.

All of this is simply because of `the need` that we have to be `happy`. if we look at our individual experience, we know that, we dont even have the control over our next thought, but we never realized that. We cant be sure what sort of thought, the next-one would be. so searching for happiness is something we really can’t control. similary experiencing happiness is also the same, doesnt last. changes often. but we want to keep it(happiness) for long, ever lasting. but so far no one has suceeded. if we cant control the next thought, then there is no guarantee that i would be able to `satisfy` my need to be happy and stay in a specific dream state. That means we never had the `control` over either being happy or sad, but experienced those emotions as and when it happened.

so do you really know yourself ? if you knew, you would have `controlled` it by now. Perhaps that’s not that easy. would you `endure hardship` on a need that you never had the control or the capability to satisfy ?. so may be our thinking hasn’t really helped us evolve outside our `mental frame`. (a.k.a outside my mindset. meaning : outside the collection of mind types, that you can experiance based on your current knowledge model).

wouldn't it be better to find this out `first`? rather than trying do same old usual thinking. its like having a machine that you don't understand. what will happen when you don't know something , you start trying out things. based on the outcome you will make certain assumptions. then you try to use the machine with those assumptions. but does it ever give out continuous expectations (happiness).it does not. Perhaps something is wrong. Either we have understood it wrong or this machine cant be controlled to gain continuous happiness. 

then <b>  isn’t it better to find that out before anything else in life ? </b>

> Your understanding of how does this mind work accurate ?

> Can you ever really control your mind ?

Thats why I started Search `Dhamma` (also known as `Dharmathaa`). English meaning ` "its a behaviour of a forming shape, which becomes a formation" (some are felt as real). some of those formations can be identified by your six sensors.`
